// 1. Create a custom `useLocalStorage` hook that functions identically to `useState` by returning an array where the first element is the value and the second element is the function to set the value. This hook should take two arguments. The first is a string which is the key for `localStorage` and the second is the initial value of the state.
// 2. Whenever the state changes it should be synced with `localStorage` so that if you were to refresh your page nothing would change as all values are pulled from `localStorage` on initial load and stored in `localStorage` when changed.

// 1. Ensure that the `useLocalStorage` hook works just like `useState` in that you can pass it a value or function as the initial value.
// 2. Use JSON to serialize and deserialize the values stored in `localStorage` so that it will work with any value (such as arrays or objects).
